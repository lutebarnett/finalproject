# Progress Updates (March 15 - April 12)

## Week 4 (March 29 - April 5)

### What did your team do last week?
* We managed to find a way to switch scenes from a main menu to something like a game
* The RPG part is coming along nicely as a fight mechanic has been achieved
	- Furthermore, more classes and subclasses of characters were created
	- A GUI for the RPG fights was created
	- The original idea for a large variety of enemies was scrapped in favor of merely 3 different ones: Minion, Miniboss, Final Boss
		- Must try to create unique names
			- Or make them all generic just for fun
* The base of what will be the RPG section/Story mode was created
	- There will be buttons that represents sections within the game
		- There will only be 4 sections, each with a different fight

### What will you do this week?
* Try to finish the game complete by doing the following:
	- Finish creating the minesweeper game
	- Create a coherent story
	- Create a continuous save file
	- Fully finish the RPG fights by allowing interchangeable Characters/Enemies
* Maybe make the game a little colorful/not completely black and white

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We may have found a way to make the game scenes changeable but we are not completely experienced with implementing this part
	- We also need each individual FXML file to have different javafx classes that give each scene more unique mechanics
* Group member James will no longer be helping us as he had apparently dropped the class
	- Though this is not that big of a deal considering he contributed literally nothing so far
* Creating jokes for the RPG Story
	- Also creating more unique dialogue for enemies in RPG fight

## Week 3 (March 22 - March 29)

### What did your team do last week?
* We created an RPGScreen that allows the user to battle against an enemy
* Remade the main menu as well as finding a way to create a brand new scene with a single button

### What will you do this week?
* Create a strange story for said RPG
* Find a way for the main menu to delete itself by a single click of a button
* Somehow create a transition from the main menu to the game to an RPG battle
	- In other words, how to make the scenes transition from one things to another
* Remake the RPG battle scene in such a way that the battle happens with a wide range on enemies
	- In other words, make it so that the enemies that are being fought, are different from time to time

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We have no idea on how to transition from one scene to another scene while deleting the previous window
* We also have no idea on how to purposefully influence the scene when it starts up.
	- For example, in scene builder a button will have one name but we want it so that the text on the button can be immediately changed
	  by itself when the window pops up
* We need a better way to talk to our newest group member, James
	- And better coordination when it comes to meeting up and working on the project




## Week 2 (March 15 - March 22)

### What did your team do last week?
* Create the new subclasses of Tile, Mine and Empty

### What will you do this week?
* Create a new Class Diagram to better illustrate what shall be done
* Create a new title screen which the program will start on
* Better identify what our RPG aspect will have
* Create a strange story for said RPG

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We need a better, more clarified plan for the game
* John and Lute have already decided their own parts on the game. John will focus on the RPG aspect while Lute will have
* to do the minesweeper part
	- The things we have to address is James as we haven't talked with him a lot and we need to decide his role/job
* The end of the year is approaching and all other classes are showing up with final tasks/projects/assignments/exams.
	- It will be difficult to juggle multiple tasks at once in addition to the game
* We need to find a time when all of us can drop everything and come to the library to work on the game
